        <p>The Services also enable third-party tracking mechanisms to collect information about you and your computing devices for use in online interest-based advertising.

Additionally, you may remove yourself from the targeted advertising of companies within the Network Advertising Initiative by opting out, or of companies participating in the Digital Advertising Alliance by opting out. Although our Services currently do not respond to “do not track” browser headers, you can limit tracking through these third-party programs and by taking the other steps discussed above. <br> If you use the Services through your mobile device, you may also opt-out of interest-based by adjusting the advertising preferences on your mobile device.
